# Bluetooth-Enabled-RC-Circumvent-BOT
Bluetooth Enabled RC Circumvent Bot project is proposed on the interest of engineers towards experiments and exploration. 
The circumvent bot is made out of a wide lasting technological subject called Arduino’s . 
It is a robot which simulates an autopilot car that can be controlled remotely and avoids obstacles in its path and changes its direction to where no obstacle is found.
It is done with the help of a control board called the HC-05 Bluetooth module which controls the motor driver shield, and the Arduino MEGA 2560 which takes the calibration 
from the Ultrasonic sensors and the Bluetooth module controller.
The controller is operated by mobile phones and is supported by a 12.6V Li-Po battery along with LM2596 DC to DC Buck Converter(3.0-40V to 1.5-35V)power supply step down module.
The input is taken from the user’s mobile phone and the command is sent to the HC-05 Bluetooth module and instructs the bot accordingly which calculates
the distance and based on those calculation the Arduino MEGA produces the output.
Using this principle we can apply this application in major projects like autopilot in Tesla cars etc.
